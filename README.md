# Huawei-Image-Denoising-Challenge-Nov-2018
Participants were required to develop an algorithm that reduces image noise whilst preserving image detail.  We were provided a training dataset containing image pairs of 975 noisy images and their corresponding clean images, which were captured using Huawei P20 smart phones across the image classes ‘buildings’, ‘text’ and ‘foliage’, together with a CSV file providing meta-data for each sample such as the ISO setting.  Then, participants had to use their codes to denoise 30 noisy unseen test images (10 from each image class) without having their corresponding clean images, and these denoised images were then submitted onto the competition website. The effectiveness of the algorithm was evaluated using PSNR and SSIM by the organisers.
